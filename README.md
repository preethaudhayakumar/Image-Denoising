# Image-Denoising
Using Probabilistic Graphical Methods ( Gibbs Sampling and Variational Inference algorithm) to denoise the given Image

Problem Statement
          1.  Implement the Gibbs sampling and variational inference algorithms for image denoising.

  [Input] 2.  The input data is a binary image corrupted with noise. Two types of data files are provided, you may choose to read 
          from either file as the input data. The first data file is in the PNG format (an image file format). The second data
          file is in the text format, where each line gives you a coordinate and the corresponding binary value denoted as 
          {0,255}.
          
  [Output] 3. The output that you will generate is a binary image with the noise removed. The output file can be either in PNG 
           or text format.
